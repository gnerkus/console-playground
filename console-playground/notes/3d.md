# File formats
## `.fbx` vs `.stl` vs `.obj` vs `.gltf`
- `.fbx` can store a wide range of data including mesh, textures, animations, and more.
- `.stl` is primarily used for 3d printing. It represents the surface geometry of a 3d object 
  using a collection of trinagular facets. STL files are simple and lightweight but they cannot 
  contain other data such as textures or animations or color - only geometry.
- `.obj` includes vertices, faces, and texture coordinates. it does not support animations or 
  advanced materials. they're often used for sharing 3d models.
- `.gltf` is similar to `.fbx` but it can also contain scene-related data. It's also compatible 
  with web applications and supports PBR
